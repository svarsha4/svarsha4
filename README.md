I am a senior at Drake University pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence at Drake University. Besides my coursework, I have gained valuable experience through three internships, which mainly centered around Data Analytics and Human Computer Interaction. Additionally, I had a variety of research experiences, even prior to the start of my first year at Drake University. As a naturally curious and highly self-motivated individual, I seeking to continue applying my enthusiasm and growing knowledge in technology and applied mathematics towards finding solutions to computational, mathematical, and business challenges.
