I am a recent Magna Cum Laude graduate of Drake University with a B.S. in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my time in college, I have gained valuable experience through 4 internships and 3 research projects, even prior to the start of my first year in college. Additionally, I have trained and competed in the NCNA Regional Programming Contest for all 4 years in college and worked on several personal projects, which significantly improved my ability to address challenges in a creative manner. 

I envision a career in the field of data analytics, with interests particularly in data engineering and data science. Data engineering fascinates me because it involves not only analyzing data but also lots of coding, designing software, and creating visual dashboards that tell a compelling "story." Meanwhile, my interest in data science lies in integrating AI to piece together different "puzzle pieces" and influence intelligent decision-making that drives progress.

Even though coming straight out of college I may not be as tech savvy as an experienced professional, I know that my insatiable curiosity and passion for finding creative solutions to problems will drive innovation at any company. In fact, this passion is a key reason why I want to pursue a career in the data analytics and tech sphere.
