# Hi there, I'm Saul! ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent Magna Cum Laude graduate of Drake University with a B.S. in Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my time in college, I have gained valuable experience through 3 internships and 3 research projects, even prior to the start of my first year in college. Additionally, I have trained and competed in the NCNA Regional Programming Contest for all 4 years in college and worked on several personal projects, which significantly improved my ability to address challenges in a creative manner. I know that my insatiable curiosity and passion for finding creative solutions to problems will drive innovation at any company. In fact, this passion is a key reason why I want to pursue a career in the data analytics and tech sphere.
